# WiiChuckGame

WiiChuckGame is a quick and dirty game using the Wii Nunchuck with simple rules.

## Rules

The goal of the game is to memorize and reproduce a random led sequence. There are 4 leds, blinking randomly, you have to use the Wii nuchuck to mimic the movements.
For example, if the led sequence is RED (up), YELLOW (left), GREEN (down), GREEN (down), RED (up), if you want to win, you have to do the same with the stick of the Nunchuck.
If you are right, the green result led will light up, otherwise, the red light will light up.
